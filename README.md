# Snark by the hour
Inspired by [Davy M](https://meta.stackoverflow.com/users/7795130/davy-m).'s [post](https://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/369938/now-that-we-can-detect-snark-what-are-we-planning-to-do-with-it) on Stack Overflow Meta as a reaction on SO's June Update. I've decided to make the _Snark by the hour_ feed happen.
It seems like a fun thing to make and I really couldn't agree more with Davy's words:
> My idea is a Snark by the Hour live feed so I can enjoy the sarcasm and snark of my favorite Stack Overflow users in real time, but that's just me.

If you happen to have a snarkiness-classifier (with a training set) laying around, feel free to let me now in an issue, or better yet; throw me a pull request. (_Yes, kind people of SO, I am hinting at you guys here._)
##To-do:
1. Gather some training data. **_In progress_**
2. Come up with a snarkiness classifier.
3. Write a classifier for questions that are likely to yield snarky comments.
4. Make some webpage to show this potentially hilarious data.
